# AudioRecognizer
Audio Recognizer is a lightweight project that demonstrates how to fine-tune and evaluate speech/audio classification models using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers, datasets, and PyTorch/Torchaudio. It uses the HuBERT model  for audio sequence classification and can be adapted to speaker identification, speech emotion recognition, or other custom tasks.
