# AudioRecognizer
Audio Recognizer is a lightweight project that demonstrates how to fine-tune and evaluate speech/audio classification models using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers, datasets, and PyTorch/Torchaudio. It uses the HuBERT model  for audio sequence classification and can be adapted to speaker identification, speech emotion recognition, or other custom tasks.

# ðŸŽ¤ Audio Recognizer

Audio Recognizer is a speech/audio classification project built with [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [Torchaudio](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html).  
It demonstrates how to train, fine-tune, and evaluate models like **HuBERT** on custom audio datasets.
